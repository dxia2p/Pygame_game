How to use the program:
Use WASD to move the camera around.
Click the plus button on the bottom right corner to add custom images as tiles.
Once an image is added, it can be deleted using the garbage icon on the top of the image.
Use the plus and minus signs on the bottom of the image to change its id, which should be unique. This is because when the tilemap is parsed in another program, it will be possible to assign different behaviours based on the id
If more than 12 images are added, use the arrows on the bottom panel to navigate through them.
The tilemap compression toggle determines whether or not the program will attempt to combine parts of the tilemap into larger rectangles, which will be more performant when used in a game.
To save the tilemap, click the floppy disk icon on the top left.
To load a saved tilemap, press the download icon on the top left.
The tilemap file will be stored in a JSON file in the path LevelEditor/TilemapFiles/tilemap.json

You are free to copy this program and modify its code, remember to credit me.
